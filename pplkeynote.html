            Bill Verplank
          </h3>
          <p>
            Bill Verplank is a human-factors engineer with a long career in design, research and
            education. As a fresh ME PhD from MIT he worked eight years at Xerox on the testing and
            refinement of what we now call the "desktop metaphor": bit-map graphics, keyboard and
            mouse, direct manipulation. For six years, he worked with Bill Moggridge at IDTwo and
            IDEO doing "interaction design" - bringing the insights from computers to the
            industrial design of medical instruments, GPS navigation, mobile phones, and new input
            devices (keyboards, track-balls, mice). From IDEO, he moved to Interval Research for 8
            years of innovating design methods (observation, body-storming, scenarios, metaphors)
            and researching active force-feedback ("haptics").
          </p>
          <p>
            He began teaching design and man-machine-systems as a graduate student at MIT and
            "visual thinking" and product design at Stanford in the '70s. Since then he has
            lectured regularly in human factors, user-interface design and most recently "new music
            controllers" at Stanford's CCRMA. In 2000, he joined the steering committee of the
            Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Italy and has consulted most recently with
            the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID). He co-authored ACM SIGCHI
            Curriculum Recommendations and, for seven years, taught popular tutorials on Graphical
            Interface Design and Sketching Scenarios. He is known for sketching as he talks.

            co-founded Purple Moon in 1996 to create interactive media for girls. In 1993 at the
            Banff Centre for the Arts she co- created and produced a virtual reality environment
            called Placeholder, demonstrating new applications of the medium in narrative
            engagement for multiple participants. She co- founded Telepresence Research in 1989 to
            conduct research and development in virtual reality and remote presence systems and
            applications. She has worked for computer and software companies including Atari, Apple

          <p>
            Erik is the co-founder of Ushahidi (which means "testimony" in Swahili), a web
            application created to map the reported incidents of violence happening during the
            post-election crisis in Kenya. Currently, he is working with a team of mostly-African
            programmers to continue development of this new free and open source platform that
            makes it easier to crowdsource crisis information and visualize data. Ushahidi has been
            used for disasters in Haiti and Chile, by media organizations such as Al Jazeera and
            the Washington Post, for election monitoring in India, Afghanistan, Namibia and Mexico,
            and for multiple other uses around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erik Hersman is also the founder of AfriGadget, a multi-author website that showcases
            stories of Africans solving everyday problems with little more than their creativity
            and ingenuity. Fascinated by micro-entrepreneurs, gadgets and improvisation, he is
            proving that technology is changing Africa - daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early 2010, Erik helped launch the new iHub (innovation hub) in Nairobi. It's an
            open space for the technologists, investors, tech companies and hackers in Nairobi.
            This space is a tech community facility with a focus on young entrepreneurs, web and
            mobile phone programmers and designers. It is part open community workspace
            (co-working), part vector for investors and VCs and part incubator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Raised in Sudan and Kenya, Erik brings unique energy and insight to the world of
            technology and innovation - bridging the gap between Africa and Silicon Valley. An avid
            blogger Erik writes two different technology blogs including: <a href=

          <p>
            Jason Bruges and his award-winning multidisciplinary <a href=
            "http://www.jasonbruges.com/" target="_blank">studio</a> are focused on creating interactive digital
            spaces that excite, intrigue and perform. The studio is particularly well known for
            light based design, exploring interactivity with the public and the environment through
            the highly imaginative use of materials and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jason Bruges Studio was created by Jason Bruges in 2001 and has since grown to around
            16 people with backgrounds in Architecture, Lighting Design, Product Design,
            Interaction Design and Project Management to delivers iconic public realm artwork and
            design beautiful site specific, technologically advanced, historically sensitive
            solutions and augments the environment with awe inspiring beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jason Bruges believes that exploring interaction should be accessible to as wide an
            audience as possible. When Interaction is innately about conversation, it requires more
            than one participant, so the environment or interventions the studio creates require an
            audience, viewer, playmate, critic, or observer so a feedback or an observation make
            the work complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Studio's projects typically respond to the environment they are situated within and
            exhibit a minimal environmental/ecological impact. The studio is continually
            progressing the development of sustainable art and design in relation to environmental
            science and technological innovation.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Lisa Strausfeld has been a partner in Pentagram's New York office since 2002. Her work
            lies at the intersection of physical and virtual space: where information structures
            and physical structures meet, and where the navigation of information and the
            navigation of buildings join in a single experience. She and her team specialize in
            digital information projects including the design of large-scale media installations,
            software prototypes and user interfaces, signage and websites for a broad range of
            civic, cultural and corporate clients including One Laptop per Child, GE, Litl,
            Bloomberg, Gallup, The New York Times, M.I.T., Brown University, the Museum of Arts and
            Design and the Detroit Institute of Arts. Strausfeld holds four patents relating to
            user interfaces and intelligent search and retrieval, and in 2006 she was named to the
            Senior Scientist program at the Gallup Organization. In addition to many awards and
            honors, Strausfeld was selected as one of Fast Company's "Masters of Design" in 2009
            and received the National Design Award in the category of Interaction Design in 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strausfeld studied art history and computer science at Brown University and earned
            master's degrees in architecture from Harvard University and in media arts and sciences
            from M.I.T.

            Richard Buchanan
          </h3>
          <p>
            Richard Buchanan is Professor of Design, Management, and Information Systems at the
            Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University. Before joining the
            Weatherhead faculty in 2008, he served as Head of the School of Design from 1992 until
            2002 and from 2002 until 2008 as Director of Doctoral Studies. While at Carnegie
            Mellon, he inaugurated Interaction Design programs at the Masters and doctoral level.
            He is well known for extending the application of design into new areas of theory and
            practice, writing and teaching as well as practicing with the concepts and methods of
            Interaction Design. He argues that interaction design does not stop at the flatland of
            the computer screen but extends into the personal and social life of human beings. In
            keeping with this, he has worked on the redesign of the Australian Taxation System, the
            restructuring of products and information for the United States Postal Service, and
            other consulting activities. At the Weatherhead, he has turned his work toward
            "collective interactions," focusing on problems of organizational change and a reform
            of management education around the concept of "managing by design." Buchanan is a
            widely published author and speaker. He is also Co-Editor of Design Issues, the
            international journal of design history, theory, and criticism published by the M.I.T.
            Press. He served for two terms as President of the Design Research Society, the learned
            society of the design research community. He has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago
            and an honorary doctorate from the University of Montreal.
