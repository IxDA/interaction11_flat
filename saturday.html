Dopamine is released in our brains when we recognize a pattern that our past experiences have taught us will lead to achieving our goals. It is not the achievement itself that produces the dopamine reward; it is the detection of patterns that we think will lead to success that triggers the chemical. \'False positives\' - instances where we get the shot of dopamine but then do not achieve our goals - are frustrating, but they lead to better learning about which patterns will lead to reward, and which will not. This sets up an interesting dilemma for interaction designers. On one hand, it is best to design for familiarity. The horizontal carousel design (for example) is easy to learn because of our familiarity with left-right reading conventions; and easy to recognize in new contexts, despite slight variations. So design pattern libraries serve a useful function for helping new and return users quickly grasp interface designs. But familiarity breeds contempt: we are always searching for \'revolutionary\' interaction designs. So how do we introduce entirely new interaction designs while still drawing upon the brain\'s natural learning reward system? In other words, how do we introduce something totally new, yet familiar?')"; ONMOUSEOUT="hideddrivetip()">

Marketing has been perceived as manipulative, pushy and greasy.  It\'s that breathless, in-your-face infomercial or the annoying guy calling you at dinner. Some traditional marketers have given the craft of marketing a bad name. But a new strain of marketing is less about manipulation and deception, and more about two-way conversations, transparency and personalization. It\'s about building something that people actually want to use, or writing a blog post that 200 people comment on. The old mindset has been that designers craft the product & marketers peddle the product. Today, effective marketers and designers both build loyalty, trust, perceived credibility and meaningful experiences. This directly affects profitability, retention, satisfaction and word-of-mouth recommendations. As designers venture further into creating evocative experiences, the line between design and marketing blurs even more. Now great marketing - and, yes, there is such a thing! -  comes from truly understanding who your users/customers are and what they want/need to do. Throw in deep understanding of their emotional triggers and cognitive expectations and \'marketing research\' starts to sound a lot like design research.')"; ONMOUSEOUT="hideddrivetip()">

Among these, the notion of authorship has undergone extraordinary change since I became involved in interactive media 35 years ago. My first book, Computers as Theatre, explored a metaphor for framing human-computer interaction so as to enrich our notions of interactivity and offer some new ways of thinking about its design. As network topologies have morphed and multiplied, the very notion of \'authoring\' interactive media has become more subtle and complex. Each great landmark of change - from the videogame console to emergent phenomena like social networking - has challenged and changed the idea of design authorship. In a parallel vein, authorship as a legal idea has been successively reworked.

But as we began formulating a strategy, we saw an opportunity to rethink what it meant to have a personalized brand, product and shopping experience.  Where we landed, very simply, was with a deeper, more robust idea of conversation: dynamic, real-time, transparent, social, multi-channel and controllable.  We wanted to create an individualized (not merely personalized) experience that recognizes desires, anticipates needs and provides utility, real value and service to the customer.

But accessibility is not a checklist; accessibility happens by considering it from the beginning, understanding industry best practices, and by taking a user-centered design approach. This means knowing how people with various disabilities will interact with your product in a way that is successful. Learn how to incorporate accessibility in a cost-effective manner into your projects. Jimmy Chandler will demonstrate 10 methods in 20 minutes for improved accessibility that all interaction designers can use right away. These tips will help you enhance the user experience for those without disabilities, including those using mobile devices.')"; ONMOUSEOUT="hideddrivetip()">

They know how to design sites that keep people coming back again and again. So what are the secrets? What actually motivates people online?

But as system interactions that span two or more of these older disciplines become an increasing part of our everyday lives, what of the relatively new field of interaction design, the beauty of which is not generally confined to the visual?
