				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to unveil the <a href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/program.php">detailed, day-by-day schedule</a> of speakers and events for Interaction11, so you have a better idea of how to plan your time in Boulder. We&#8217;ve taken a new approach to the program for 2011, with limited parallel tracks and specially-designed groupings of different speakers (lightning and keynote) followed by a Q&amp;A &#8220;talkback&#8221; that will let you engage with the speakers in lively discussion about what&#8217;s been presented during each session.</p>
<p>Be sure to leave your schedule open for some great times on Friday afternoon, when we leave the traditional conference presentation format to Dine Around Boulder for lunch followed by interactive physical activities that will bring you into the heart of this great city. Of course, we also have some out-of-this-world evening events planned for you courtesy of sponsors EffectiveUI and Microsoft.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re finalizing your plans, don&#8217;t forget our optional pre-conference workshops on Wednesday; there are still some spots left for some amazing learning opportunities like <a href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/workshop/index.php#JenniferBove">Winning the Work</a> with Jennifer Bove &#8212; a way to learn how to close financial deals and advance your consultancy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/wednesday.php">View all of our great programming here.</a> We look forward to seeing you in Boulder!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of you are gearing up for Boulder in February, purchasing flight information and checking out hotels. I&#8217;m hoping to clarify some of the details about the conference here, to make your travel plans easier and to help you build a plan for getting the most out of interaction eleven.</p>
<p><strong>Conference</strong>/ Our conference begins on Wednesday with pre-conference workshops. If you want to take advantage of these, you better hurry &#8211; attendance is limited. The main conference begins on Thursday, with <a href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/pplkeynote.html" target="_blank">keynotes</a>, <a href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/ppllightning.html" target="_blank">lightning sessions</a>, and some great parties and surprises. Friday morning brings more keynotes and lightning sessions, and on Friday afternoon, all attendees will enjoy activities our and about in the city of Boulder. Saturday concludes our program with <em>even more </em>keynotes and lightning sessions, and then a great closing party from our lead sponsor Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Food and Drink</strong>/ If you are budgeting for the conference, consider yourself in good hands. Included in your registration is an awesome lunch on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, heavy hors d&#8217;oeuvres on Thursday evening, an amazing dinner on Saturday, and we&#8217;ll make sure you have your fill of complimentary beer and wine throughout the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong>/ You&#8217;ll want to fly into Denver International Airport, and then we recommend <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/skyRide_SubHome.shtml" target="_blank">taking the bus from the airport to Boulder</a>. The ride will take you about 45 minutes. You can take a cab, but it&#8217;ll be really expensive ($87.50 one way); a rental car is a better option, especially if you share with a group ($40/day). We&#8217;ll shuttle you around Boulder to the various conference activities, so don&#8217;t worry about that one bit.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel/ </strong>While there are a number of hotels in Boulder, we recommend booking a room at the official conference hotel, the <a href="http://www.stjulien.com/" target="_blank">St. Julien</a>. To reserve your room and grab our special rate, call 877-303-0900<strong> </strong>and when connected to Reservations, say you are with the Interaction Design Conference. You can also email <a href="mailto:reservationsmgr@stjulien.com">reservationsmgr@stjulien.com</a> and in the subject line put: Interaction Design Conference.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>/ The temperature in Boulder in February can be tricky &#8211; sometimes its 30F, while other seasons it gets as hot as 55F. We&#8217;re counting on some snow, but part of the fun is going to be responding to whatever mother nature brings our way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have more details coming on November 1st, and we&#8217;ll have a detailed schedule coming soon after. In the meantime, if you haven&#8217;t already purchased your ticket to this great event, <a href="https://ww2.eventrebels.com/er/Registration/StepRegInfo.jsp?ActivityID=4641&amp;StepNumber=1" target="_blank">now&#8217;s a great time &#8211; it&#8217;s selling out fast</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are incredibly pleased to announce our next two invited keynote speakers, both of whom have been pivotal in defining the course of our profession.<strong> Bruce Sterling</strong> is an author, journalist, editor, and critic whose nonfiction works include <em>The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier</em> (1992), <em>Tomorrow Now: Envisioning the Next Fifty Years</em> (2003), and <em>Shaping Things</em> (2005).<strong> Richard Buchanan</strong> is a professor of Design, Management, and Information Systems at Case Western Reserve University&#8217;s Weatherhead School of Management. Prior to joining the Weatherhead faculty in 2008, he served Carnegie Mellon University first as Head of the School of Design (1992-2002) and then as Director of Doctoral Studies (2002-2008), during which time he inaugurated Interaction Design programs at the Masters and Doctorate level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interaction11’s Call for Participation will be closing at the end of the week this Saturday, July 31st, at 11:59 p.m. EST. We’ve already received a healthy number of topic submissions from the well-prepared, highly-organized, and consistently punctual individuals, but we know there’s also a significant contingency of last-minuteists out there who need reminders and gentle prods before they finally make time to submit. If you’re part of that latter group, this message is for you &#8212; put the procrastination on the back burner for an hour or so and write up your idea for a workshop, lightning round, or activity.</p>
