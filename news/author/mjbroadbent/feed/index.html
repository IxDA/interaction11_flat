				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An amazing 235 entries were received in answer to &#8220;Why should Microsoft send YOU to Interaction11?&#8221; between Tuesday evening and noontime today, Friday. (Microsoft was giving away three complimentary registration passes.)</p>
<p>Entries were reviewed solely on content. &#8220;We were very impressed by such enthusiastic participation. In our review, we looked for people whom we believed to be truly revealing of themselves and who would add to the larger conversation; people we all would like to meet at the conference.&#8221; The field was eventually narrowed to 26 favorites from which a random selection was made and then the names were revealed.</p>
<p>The winners are&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Aurea de Souza</li>
<li>James R. L. Martin</li>
<li>Juan Rafael Lopez</li>
</ul>
<p>These three lucky individuals have been notified by email and will have until 12 noon U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 24 to confirm they will attend. Three runners-up were also selected (but not notified) in case one of the winners is unable to accept.</p>
<p>Diamond conference sponsor Microsoft thanks IxDA for their assistance in facilitating the give-away. And IxDA thanks Microsoft for their generous patronage!</p>
<p>UPDATE: All three winners have accepted and are now registered to attend. IxDA and Microsoft thanks everyone who entered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome 2011! February 9-12 is just around the corner now. Many of you have already made your travel and lodging arrangements; if you&#8217;re one of those last-minute people, check out our <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/boulderama.html">Boulderama</a> section for full details. Once you&#8217;re in Boulder and staying at one of our six <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/stay.html">conference hotels</a>, rest assured, we&#8217;ve got your transportation covered to and from all the <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/maps.html">official conference venues</a>. Everything is within about a one-kilometer radius (very walk-able if you&#8217;re so inclined) but we&#8217;ll be getting you around via dedicated shuttle buses on a loop. This will be no ordinary busing experience though: be prepared for some fun and interesting &#8220;interactions&#8221; associated with the shuttle loop, courtesy of a crackerjack BDW student team as well as IxDA Global-Local Committee Chairs Angel Anderson and Josh Kaufman. Stay tuned&#8230;we&#8217;ll have detailed maps ready for you shortly.</p>
<p>Calling all alpine enthusiasts: Tickets are still available for <a href="https://www.skiixda.com/" target="_blank">CP+B&#8217;s Epic Mix</a> experience at Vail and special IxDA discount rates are now available for <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/do.html">ski-on-your-own options</a> at Eldora and Breckenridge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interaction11 media partner Johnny Holland posted an interview today with Ushahidi founder Erik Hersman, one of our conference keynote speakers. JH talked with Erik about his hopes and dreams for crowdsourcing, and the role interaction designers can play in fulfilling that dream. Erik also gave a brief preview of some of the topics he&#8217;ll address at Interaction11:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to touch on some of the constraints and cultural difference in Africa that make designing and launching new services here so different than their counterparts in the rest of the world. It’ll be about how we see the world differently, making it hard for people with Western assumptions of what the internet and phones are to design for Africa.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently learned that the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/9395674" target="_blank">Interaction11 kickoff video</a> &#8212; created and donated by the dynamic duo at Cruz Dann Productions (plus a dedicated group of on- and off-screen volunteers) &#8212; has been recognized by the International Academy of Visual Arts with a Gold Award from the 2010 W3 Awards in the Branded Content Category: Promotional/Branding.</p>
<p>W3 Awards honor creative excellence on the web and recognize the professionals behind the work. The W3 is the first major web competition to be accessible to the biggest agencies, the smallest firms, and everyone in between. The W3 is judged by the International Academy of the Visual Arts, an invitation-only body consisting of top-tier professionals whose members include executives from organizations such as Conde Nast, Disney, HBO, MTV, Wired, Yahoo! and many others.</p>
<p>How great is it to have people in our community recognized for exemplifying IxDA mission values of individual initiative, contribution, and sharing? Congratulations all around!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased and honored to announce interaction design pioneer <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/speakers.html" target="_blank">Bill Verplank</a> as our final invited keynote speaker. If you&#8217;re a new to the field, Bill is a human-factors engineer with an extraordinary career in design, research, and education. He&#8217;s been teaching and creating design-related curricula since he  was a MIT graduate student. He lectures regularly in human factors,  user-interface design and, most recently, &#8220;new music controllers&#8221; at  Stanford. Between 1986-1992, while consulting with IDEO to bring graphical user-interfaces into the product design world, Bill began calling the work &#8220;interaction design&#8221; instead of &#8220;user-interface design&#8221;. Consider for a moment how our field has burgeoned since then, in such a short time. Wow!</p>
<p>Bill completes our stellar array of keynote speakers who, together with emerging voices from our community of practice, will engage Interaction11 attendees in state-of-the-world discussion. Full program details coming October 1!</p>
<p>Only six weeks left <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/reg.html" target="_blank">save your seat</a> for $650&#8230;the price jumps November 1.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce our fifth keynote, <strong>Erik Hersman</strong>. Erik is the co-founder of Ushahidi (which means &#8220;testimony&#8221; in  Swahili), a web application created to map the reported incidents of  violence happening during the post-election crisis in Kenya.  Currently,  he is working with a team of mostly-African programmers to continue  development of this new free and open source platform that makes it  easier to crowdsource crisis information and visualize data.  Ushahidi  has been used for disasters in Haiti and Chile, by media organizations  such as Al Jazeera and the Washington Post, for election monitoring in  India, Afghanistan, Namibia and Mexico, and for multiple other uses  around the world.</p>
<p>Erik, who just enjoyed a great profile in <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1677605/while-kenya-votes-ushahidi-does-its-part" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>, joins our <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/speakers.html" target="_self">other great keynotes</a>. The conference looks to be pretty great &#8211; <a href="http://interaction11.ixda.org/reg.html" target="_self">have you registered yet</a>?!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are seeing an astounding and prolific influx of community submissions &#8212; particularly as the deadline approaches. (Excellent work, all you wicked procrastinators.) That said, it came to our attention this evening that there is some confusion about the actual cut-off time: July 31 or August 1? Both dates were in our multi-channel communications. Since IxDA is a global community based on individual initiative (however late-breaking it may be) <strong>we will close the Call for Participation Sunday, August 1 at 11:59 PM U.S. Eastern Time.</strong> Thank you for your enthusiastic participation!</p>
