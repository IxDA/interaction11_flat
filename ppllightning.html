          </h5>
          <p>
            Adam Connor has spent nearly a decade in the User Experience Design world. As a Senior
            Experience Designer with Mad*Pow in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Adam combines his
            creative and technical backgrounds to design effective, efficient, and easy-to-use
            websites, applications, and interactive media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, Adam spent eight years as an in-house designer for a large financial
            services firm and six years as an independent UX Consultant. As an Experience Design
            instructor, he taught undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts,
            Amherst, focusing on research techniques, interaction design, information architecture,
            and usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adam has spent the past year investigating what happens when his Computer Science and
            Film &amp; Animation background are put to the test, thoroughly exploring the
            connection between film and User Experience Design. By studying how well-made films
            engage and captivate viewers, Adam then translates movies into UX Design terms with a
            filmmaker's eye to tell a story with design.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he's not answering the question, "What do film and UX have in common?" Adam takes
            his design skills offline to his sketchpad and the piles of Legos he routinely
            transforms into movie scenes and other creations.

            growing up in a quiet Midwestern farm town to hopping around the globe, he has always
            closely observed how people live, work, and interact with each other. After studying
            business in the United States and design in Italy, he spends his days building web
            sites, mobile platforms, interactive installations and strategic roadmaps. Currently,
            he has dedicated his life to writing, speaking, and designing for projects that
            encourage a better balance of friends, family, life, and work.<br />
            <br />
            When he's not designing, he can be found singing karaoke, dancing tango, and drinking
            whiskey. He currently resides in Manhattan and can be found at Jo's every Sunday night.

            Peter Stahl is a senior interaction designer at Cisco, where he works on design
            standards. A longtime denizen of Silicon Valley, he has created user experiences for
            eBay, America Online, Microsoft, Netscape, Entrust, among others, for applications as
            diverse as e-commerce, system management, online conferencing, gesture-based pen
            computing, 3D social environments and desktop productivity. While at eBay, he led
            development of a library of design patterns, for which he and Josh Damon Williams of
            Hot Studio pioneered a new methodology for Interaction Audits, which they presented at
            IA Summit and Web 2.0 Expo. Peter also led eBayis notorious Pattern Optimization Squad
            (POPS) that approves design patterns, and was impresario of the Polynesian-themed Page
            Parsing Parties, where designs are deconstructed into their constituent
            components.<br />
            <br />
            When he's not working, Peter can often be found tooting his oboe and English horn in
            Redwood Symphony, an ambitious Bay Area community orchestra. He also publishes his
            recommendations on California ballot propositions at peterates.com. He holds a degree
            in music theory and composition from Harvard.

            Scott Newson has worked with: farmers, engineers, artists, programmers, geologists,
            students, and soccer-playing-children. Working with the MyHomeYourHome: Tiny House
            Project, he got to question how life can be lived with limited residential
            square-footage and, at the same time, learn how difficult it is to grow a vibrant
            community around a wiki. At the student-run cafe at university he chopped veggies so
            well that he was promoted to develop and run the bulk ordering system, in the process
            experiencing the trails and tribulations that come with providing healthy food to
            stressed and time-starved students. He recently went to Scotland for the summer to
            write code for a geology company, and got to experience the wonders of the widespread

            <br />
            He is studying Computer Science, Psychology, Linguistics, and Anthropology at the
            University of British Columbia, and will be graduating in the next year. He generally
            works at the interface between software developers and specific users, having learnt
            geology, food preparation and basic construction to speak with end users in their own

            Susan Wyche is a Computing Innovation Fellow at Virginia Tech's Center for
            Human-Computer Interaction. Her research focuses on human-computer interaction, design
            and cultural studies of technology. In her dissertation, Wyche used religion as a lens
            to understand how alternative worldviews can inform design. She has explored how
            Muslims in Atlanta, Charismatic Pentecostals in Sao Paulo, and Protestant Christians in
            Nairobi, use mobile phones, computers, and the Internet to support their religious
            practices. Each study has resulted in a publication at top-tier conference in her
            field, multiple design concepts, and in one case, a mobile phone application available
            for download at Apple Inc.'s "App Store."<br />
            <br />
            Prior to coming to VaTech, Wyche received her PhD in Human-Centered Computing from the
            Georgia Institute of Technology, her master's degree from Cornell University and her
            undergraduate degree in Industrial Design from Carnegie Mellon University. In addition
            to her academic pursuits, Wyche has professional design experience, most notably
            working at Libbey Inc. designing glassware and as a design researcher for S.C. Johnson
            Inc.
