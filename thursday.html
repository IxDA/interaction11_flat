Additionally, the pressure to design a \'usable\' system often prevents designers from taking risks and exploring superior solutions than what may be found by using traditional \'off the self\' GUI widgets. The lost relevance of these common patterns is clouding the future of interaction design and creating a barrier to well-designed products. This clouding effect can manifest as \'complacency artifacts\' that appear in the design solutions we create when we do not apply the appropriate degree of design diligence.

First, I describe the constraints participants encountered when using technology in an infrastructure-poor setting. These constraints are limited bandwidth, high costs, differing perceptions of responsiveness, and threats to security. Second, I use these findings to critically evaluate the \'access, anytime and anywhere\' construct shaping the design of future technologies.

Careful consideration of the interaction and visual design is of paramount importance to any company wishing to grow their customer base or loyalty. The importance of visual interface design has risen sharply since the introduction of smart phones and tablets and is becoming ever more complex. Executives now care more than ever about the visual interface and what it means to their brand. So how does one stand out? This talk will help designers create visual interfaces for dense, complex products and make their experiences memorable and useful. The talk highlights some of the key differences between more traditional visual design mediums and designing for the interface. It will also discuss how to design a unique visual interface but put the needs of users first, how to add surprise and delight to critical moments of the experience, and how craftsmanship and attention to detail can set you apart in a visually complex medium.')"; ONMOUSEOUT="hideddrivetip()">

How can the technologies of automation and monitoring that support large-scale corporate farming be redesigned for local small-scale agriculture? The growBot Garden project explores these questions by bringing together interaction designers, farmers and other food producers to ask: How might robotics and sensing technologies be used in support of local small-scale agriculture? In this lightening session we will present the growBot Garden project, calling attention to both it\'s specific successes and failures, and the broader challenges and opportunities of melding co-design and interaction design in the context of sustainable agriculture.

The best such experiences induce a state of flow, in Csikszentmihalyi\'s sense, during which users get into such a groove that the mechanics of operating the program disappear, allowing users to focus entirely on meaning. Flow is associated with increased learning and positive feelings. Great flows can even cause users to regard the interaction itself as intrinsically rewarding. (Wouldn\'t that be awesome?)
