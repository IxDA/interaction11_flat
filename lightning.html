            As more and more people live longer, the number of people with disabilities will
            continue to rise. The good news is that web applications can enhance the lives of
            people with disabilities. The bad news is that many applications are poorly designed
            for this increasingly significant audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Too often, people approach accessibility only when required to, and simply by looking
            at a checklist. But accessibility is not a checklist; accessibility happens by
            considering it from the beginning, understanding industry best practices, and by taking
            a user-centered design approach. This means knowing how people with various
            disabilities will interact with your product in a way that is successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learn how to incorporate accessibility in a cost-effective manner into your projects.
            Jimmy Chandler will demonstrate 10 methods in 20 minutes for improved accessibility
            that all interaction designers can use right away. These tips will help you enhance the
            user experience for those without disabilities, including those using mobile devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of this session, you will understand how to include people with disabilities
            in usability studies, what the most important principles of accessibility are, how to
            look out for the biggest pitfalls, and where to go and what to do next.

            Applying Film Making Tools to Interaction Design

            When it comes to setting the stages upon which individuals build experiences, Designers
            can look to a number of industries for lessons and inspiration. The film industry, over
            its long life, has at times both excelled and fallen short of honoring its audience
            with solid material and engaging stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well-made films have shown us that they can drive engagement and interaction. The
            marketing world has long used this to its advantage. Films succeed in evoking responses
            and engaging the audiences only when there is a combination of well-written narrative
            and effective storytelling techniques. It's the film maker's job to put this
            combination together, and to do so they've developed an extensive set of tools and
            techniques that allow them to focus (and disrupt) attention, emphasize information,
            foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're responsible for creating products that aren't just easy to use, but that people
            desire to use. Our designs should drive users to want to interact with them. It stands
            to reason that the methods being used in the film industry to communicate with and
            engage audiences can also be used in the interaction design space.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this presentation is to extend the current topic of the use of stories
            in design and focus on the technical aspects used in film to communicate with
            audiences. We'll look at some tools used by film makers such as: cinematic patterns,
            beat sheets, storyboards and editing techniques. We'll consider how, why and when
            they're used and which aspects of these tools we can make use of as Designers.

            Beautiful Interactions: Codifying Aesthetics In Interaction Design

            In established design fields &mdash; i.e., architecture, graphic design, and industrial
            design &mdash; much has been written about what makes design under these classifications
            beautiful. Common design elements such as form, line, balance, unity, variety, rhythm,
            contrast, texture and color have been analyzed and presented to design students for
            decades, resulting in codified visual languages that constitute good design.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as system interactions that span two or more of these older disciplines become an
            increasing part of our everyday lives, what of the relatively new field of interaction
            design, the beauty of which is not generally confined to the visual? What are the
            design elements that make an interaction beautiful and to what human senses do they
            appeal? In what ways are these beauty-forming elements similar or different from other
            design disciplines? Which ones are new? Which are shared?
          </p>
          <p>
            Through cross-analysis of these related design fields and general notions of beauty
            throughout the world, I will define what makes an interaction beautiful and propose a
            theoretical framework for codifying design elements in interaction design.

            Why is it that computer science curriculums in the United States have such a hard time
            attracting and keeping prospective female students? Many university computer science
            curriculums focus on the theoretical rather than the practical applications of the
            science. Many of the women I've encountered are looking for something more hands-on,
            with more direct social benefit. Interaction Design as a field hits the right balance
            of technology, social benefit, and creativity &mdash;  but our chosen career is still
            relatively unknown outside the walls of this convention! This session will discuss
            trends in computing education, and suggest outreach activities to get the word out and
            spark the imaginations of the next generation of career women (and men).

            Have we lost balance in life? Our daily routine moves in hyperdrive with content
            creation, curation, and consumption at every step. It is now possible to shoot, edit,
            and upload a video before your morning coffee, yet it is also possible to spend an
            entire 8 hour shift without leaving the warm glow of Google reader. Designers and
            developers now have the tools to build highly influential devices and systems which
            users can be defenseless against. From the eyes of our clients, we are designing
            beautiful systems where users pleasantly consume glorious amounts of rich content, yet
            how is this impacting our overall lives? We are now only a misguided click from falling
            down a rabbit hole of continual consumption. As we witness more and more people being
            constantly connected to at least one form of media, we must consider the ugly side of
            our beautiful designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wish to analyze the balance of consumption, curation, and creation throughout history
            and will attempt to determine what an ideal balance is. I will then estimate when,
            where, and how today's designs have influenced our everyday balance of life. Finally I
            will instruct upon how to design systems which encourage a positive change towards a
            healthy balance in life. As a community that prides itself upon a building a better
            world, it's time to turn hyperdrive off, and take a much needed step back to ensure
            that we are moving in a positive direction.

            Interaction design and the broader user experience design field have no ethics
            guidelines. Practitioners take shortcuts due to time and budget pressures, participate
            in questionable business practices and projects, and act without considered thought.
            These all have a direct impact on ethical lapses and opens the door to unintentional
            mistreatment of our clients and peers, participants in research studies, and the people
            who use our designs. In contrast, other design disciplines (architecture, graphic
            design, industrial design) and social sciences (anthropology, psychology, sociology)
            have long-established ethics frameworks. Behavior of professionals and how work product
            is handled and used are shaped by ethical principles and practices. This ethical
            imperative aims to protect stakeholders' welfare and govern how practitioners treat
            them. Issues and scenarios discussed include: Privacy/publicy, locus of control,
            default choices, and digital, physical, social, and emotional aspects of our practice.
            This session is recommended for anyone who wishes to address the ethical challenges
            we face in day-to-day practice, and begin thinking about how to best bring design ethics
            to our work.

Today, Photoshop.com attracts more than 3 million unique visitors per month, and provides a mix of tips, techniques, stories, and online photo tools for a diverse audience. This presentation tells the story of how the Adobe XD (Experience Design) team, using a design-driven strategy, collaborated with engineering and marketing on a top-to-bottom redesign of  photoshop.com. You'll get a behind-the-scenes look at how we drove a customer-centric design concept to market. We'll also describe our practices for designing the ecosystem of web pages, web apps, and mobile apps at the heart of Photoshop.com.

			As designers explore how to appropriately develop technology for users in the developing world, they must reconsider the interaction styles embedded in the applications and devices they create. In this talk, I present results from a study examining how professionals living and working in Nairobi, Kenya, use computers in their everyday lives. There are two takeaways from this presentation.  First, I describe the constraints participants encountered when using technology in an infrastructure-poor setting. These constraints are limited bandwidth, high costs, differing perceptions of responsiveness, and threats to security. Second, I use these findings to critically evaluate the "access, anytime and anywhere" construct shaping the design of future technologies. I present an alternative vision called "deliberate interactions" &mdash; a planned and purposeful interaction style that involves offline preparation &mdash; and describe how technology can be designed to support this online usage behavior.

            By demonstrating a variety of successful solutions to problems, the goal is to broaden
            the pallet of tools interaction designers consider. This is not to suggest that digital
            solutions are inferior, but to demonstrate a variety of approaches and to initiate
            discussion around how different approaches might be appropriate for different
            situations.

            This would be most interesting to individuals working for clients and looking for

            interesting to theorists and artists, but they might also benefit from discussing a
            variety of solutions to interaction problems.

            Over the past 100 years, design had played a significant role in advancing
            agri-business by producing products, systems, and services that support large-scale
            corporate farming. The question we ask is, Can design now play a role in shifting us
            towards more sustainable modes of agriculture? What kinds of products, services and
            systems would need to be designed that shift? How can the technologies of automation
            and monitoring that support large-scale corporate farming be redesigned for local
            small-scale agriculture? The growBot Garden project explores these questions by
            bringing together interaction designers, farmers and other food producers to ask: How
            might robotics and sensing technologies be used in support of local small-scale
            agriculture?
          </p>
          <p>
            The growBot Garden project is structured around a series of public and participatory
            design workshops that draw from practices of co-design design, critical design,
            tactical media and hacking. In these workshops, people come together to collaboratively
            make speculative representations and prototypes of possible, alternative, agricultural
            futures. These representations and prototypes are documented and shared through public
            forums to provoke consideration of new assemblages that might emerge at the
            intersection of technology and agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this lightening session we will present the growBot Garden project, calling
            attention to both it's specific successes and failures, and the broader challenges and
            opportunities of melding co-design and interaction design in the context of sustainable
            agriculture. Attendees will be inspired, and too, will come away with a case-study of
            socially-engaged interaction design they can extend to their own projects.

            We find ourselves at a critical moment in the evolution of healthcare. The progress of
            medical science means that people can now overcome many previously fatal and
            debilitating conditions, and we know enough for most people on the planet to live long,
            healthy lives. But we are not yet achieving this dream: even people who have access to
            healthcare are not universally enjoying the kind of outcomes science suggests they
            should, and the cost of healthcare has been rising quickly, to the point it is in
            danger of being unsustainable, on a personal and global level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the public debate, it's easy to see this as a policy issue, but the
            politicians, doctors and insurers could use a hand in the imagination department. Many
            of the biggest opportunities to improve healthcare have to do with interfaces and
            interactions. Some of these interfaces and interactions have to do with onscreen GUI's,
            and some are between people and institutions. Almost all of them stand to benefit from
            the kind of holistic, imaginative problem-solving designers can help with.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk, I'll briefly frame the big opportunities for interaction designers to
            help revolutionize healthcare, from encouraging healthy behavior by individuals, to
            increasing the reach and impact of healthcare institutions, to improving the way care
            is delivered by those institution. The bulk of the talk will focus on design strategies
            for this latter area, using examples from work I've been involved in as well as from
            the broader industry. Topics will include clinical decision support, knowledge-enabled
            workflow management, treatment and other point-of-care interfaces, and how systems can
            better enable the practice of evidence-based medicine.

			There has been a historical divide between human-centered design for the physical world &mdash; considered the domain of industrial designers and engineers &mdash; and the digital world &mdash; the domain of user experience designers, information architects, and human-computer interaction specialists. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We are entering an era of ubiquitous computing where digital experiences will no longer be limited to desktop computers and mobile devices and will seamlessly integrate into everyday objects and activities. As this intersection between technology and the physical world becomes more central to our everyday lives, there is a need for a new, cross-disciplinary approach where industrial and digital user experience designers look to each other for input and to create new standards. 
		</p>		
		<p>
			Based on their experience and backgrounds in both industrial design and user experience design, Austin and Lindsay will demonstrate how they've redesigned three everyday objects based on the combined disciplines of industrial and digital interaction design. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From this process, they will demonstrate the design aspects that these two disciplines can learn from one another, such as:  
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Using affordances to help users understand how to interact with an interface</li>
			<li>Providing feedback about what a system is doing or how an interface is reacting to an input or action</li>
			<li>Using mappings and mental models to enhance understanding and learnability</li>
			<li>Using data visualization to increase understanding and motivate behavior</li>
			<li>Using gaming models to incentivize participation/use and to increase user enjoyment</li>
			<li>Using joy or moments of delight to help users build a relationship with a product or grow into a product through exploration</li>

			About 9 months ago, I started a fairly innocent task of creating an experience strategy for a personalization initiative introduced by our client, a major telecom service company.  As would be expected, the client's initial focus was primarily on marketing opportunities: getting the best offer in front of the right person at the right time.  But as we began formulating a strategy, we saw an opportunity to rethink what it meant to have a personalized brand, product and shopping experience.  Where we landed, very simply, was with a deeper, more robust idea of conversation: dynamic, real-time, transparent, social, multi-channel and controllable.  We wanted to create an individualized (not merely personalized) experience that recognizes desires, anticipates needs and provides utility, real value and service to the customer.  But how could it be done?  What would it do for the company? What would be needed to support it?
			</p>
			<p>
			This presentation will ask more questions than give answers.  Rather than give you a reveal of Everything We Learned, a fully-baked case study, or prescriptions for design this presentation will meditate on some issues that have arisen in the midst of designing for cross-channel personalization, issues that will have implications on our design future.

		<p>
		Classic divisions of labor, print prejudices, institutional inertia and ivory tower thinking are no longer viable, as content producers both large and small struggle to remain relevant and profitable.

            If you can't quite make every type of user mistake impossible, then you should at least
            make them fun, right? Game mechanics and game design techniques have been a much
            proliferated meme in the UX, IxD, and design worlds as of late (for varying definitions
            of 'late'). Touted as a 'solution' to the challenge of motivating certain behavior in
            users, or making experiences more engaging, sadly these elements of the game
            development world are often blindly applied without finesse or elegance - akin to to
            hitting the user over the head with a colorful hammer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an effort to put this right, and help correct the flaws in the application of game
            mechanics that our team was seeing over and over again, we put together this 10 Step
            Plan to borrowing from the world of game design when considering your interaction and
            user interface design. Game design techniques aren't applicable to every interaction
            design situation, but when they are they can make the experience that much more
            compelling, sticky and entertaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learn when, and when not to consider game design and mechanics, and how best to
            leverage them when appropriate. Learn why game mechanics aren't just a set of
            interrelated feedback loops (with a heavy set of rules) and see how to integrate
            classic mechanics, such as collection and feedback, as well more interesting elements
            such as obstacles, difficulty, competitions and mini games. Finally, learn how and when
            to use the most interesting game mechanic of all: rewards. Oh, and most importantly:
            learn how to stay true to the interaction you're designing without turning it into an
            actual game.

            Mention "marketing" to most design professionals and their thoughts turn to bloated ad
            campaigns based on broad conclusions drawn from dated demographic research. Marketing
            has been perceived as manipulative, pushy and greasy. It's that breathless,
            in-your-face infomercial or the annoying guy calling you at dinner. Some traditional
            marketers have given the craft of marketing a bad name.
          </p>
          <p>
            But a new strain of marketing is less about manipulation and deception, and more about
            two-way conversations, transparency and personalization. It's about building something
            that people actually want to use, or writing a blog post that 200 people comment on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old mindset has been that designers craft the product &amp; marketers peddle the
            product. Today, effective marketers and designers both build loyalty, trust, perceived
            credibility and meaningful experiences. This directly affects profitability, retention,
            satisfaction and word-of-mouth recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As designers venture further into creating evocative experiences, the line between
            design and marketing blurs even more. Now great marketing - and, yes, there is such a
            thing! - comes from truly understanding who your users/customers are and what they
            want/need to do. Throw in deep understanding of their emotional triggers and cognitive
            expectations and "marketing research" starts to sound a lot like design research.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remember the TV ads that make us cry - marketers count on that. But designers know
            that products that deliver a compelling and elegant experience stand out from the crowd
            because they evoke and sustain emotion from the user. Great marketing, like great
            design, goes for our hearts as well as our heads.

            uses content, typography and motion to define its visual identity. The Metro
            principles can be used to develop integrated apps on devices as well as beautiful web
            experiences. For example, you can take pictures with your phone's camera and
            immediately go see them on the web without losing context making the experience feel
            personal, relevant and always connected. The focus on the user's content with our
            signature motion and type helps unify the experience regardless of how and on which
            platform it was built.

            Designers have grown complacent &mdash; overly dependent on anachronistic
design patterns to provide ready-made solutions for the design problem at
hand. In many cases this complacency is exacerbated by process, schedule or
resource constraints that have always been a factor in preventing designers
from truly innovating for users. Additionally, the pressure to design a 'usable'
system often prevents designers from taking risks and exploring superior
solutions than what may be found by using traditional 'off the self' GUI
widgets.
			</p>
			<p>
The lost relevance of these common patterns is clouding the future of
interaction design and creating a barrier to well-designed products. This
clouding effect can manifest as 'complacency artifacts' that appear in the
design solutions we create when we do not apply the appropriate degree of
design diligence. To create new solutions that are engaging, relevant and
usable, interaction designers must understand the mechanisms of control logic
underlying commonly used GUI widgets.
</p>
			<p>
Armed with an understanding of the abstraction of control logic, designers
can identify their own complacency artifacts and begin formulating new and
differentiated interaction models that provide value to clients and end users
alike.
</p>
			<p>
While it may seem scandalous to reject design orthodoxy, we are finding
ourselves working with an increasingly unconstrained medium with limitless
possibilities, so let’s bring scandal back to design and reject the limitations of
the past. It makes things far more interesting!

            This talk will present the innovation process, the implementation of participatory
            culture and the appropriation of technologies as it is experienced in Tecnobrega,
            Brazil's "Cheesy Techno". This music turned many conventions of the mainstream music
            industry upside down. Its musicians decided to forgo copyright in favor of allowing
            their music to circulate (and mutate) freely. Today, in a city with very limited
            economic resources, Tecnobrega is a thriving, commercially viable, industry. The
            genre's audiences, not only assist in the circulation of content, but through their
            socializing (on and off-line), they create and trade symbolic capital that directly
            affects the popularity, and consequently the perception of value, of various parts of
            the industry. Tecnobrega's commercial success relies as much on the non-monetary
            contributions of Tecnobrega audiences and fans as it does the market forces that shape
            the production and distribution of cultural goods. A good part of its legitimate
            revenue, for instance, is drawn from sales through 'pirate' street vendors and of
            'unprofessional' live recordings. Similarly, Tecnobrega's equipes &mdash; the groups
            super-fans of the genre organize themselves into &mdash; eventually see financial rewards for
            their proselytizing and evangelizing of the culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brazil's has become an increasingly relevant market; this case study offers a glimpse
            into its proactive, heterogeneous and creative audiences. It is the result of
            ethnographic research I conducted while at the Convergence Culture Consortium at MIT.

            Dopamine is released in our brains when we recognize a pattern that our past experiences have taught us will lead to achieving our goals. It is not the achievement alone that produces the dopamine reward; it is the detection of patterns that we think will lead to success that first triggers the chemical. “False positives”—instances where we get the shot of dopamine but then do not achieve our goals-- are frustrating, but they lead to better learning about which patterns will lead to reward, and which will not. This sets up an interesting dilemma: How can designers introduce something totally new, yet familiar? This discussion should appeal to audiences interested in connections between cognitive/linguistic theory and interaction design, illustrated with real-world examples.

            Most interactions have an underlying rhythm. For example, an application may ask a user
            to scan a list of items, then click to select one, leading to another list to scan and
            click. Scan, click, scan, click. The best such experiences induce a state of flow, in
            Csikszentmihalyi's sense, during which users get into such a groove that the mechanics
            of operating the program disappear, allowing users to focus entirely on meaning. Flow
            is associated with increased learning and positive feelings. Great flows can even cause
            users to regard the interaction itself as intrinsically rewarding. (Wouldn't that be
            awesome?)
          </p>
          <p>
            As guardians of dynamic behavior, interaction designers own rhythm. Yet our work
            practice lacks appropriate tools and vocabulary. How do you portray a groove in a
            wireframe, flow chart, or PowerPoint deck? This is becoming critically important as
            things like animation, hover responses and video make their way into more and more
            interactive experiences. This is in your future.
          </p>
          <p>
            This session will dive into how we can design pacing, tempo and rhythm into our
            interfaces, with examples from the presenter and (even better!) the audience. This
            could include adapting techniques from animation and movies, game systems, audio
            interfaces, music and choreography.

            Like it or not, more and more interactions between companies and their customers are
            occurring via an interface. Careful consideration of the interaction and visual design
            is of paramount importance to any company wishing to grow their customer base or
            loyalty. The importance of visual interface design has risen sharply since the
            introduction of smart phones and tablets and is becoming ever more complex. Executives
            now care more than ever about the visual interface and what it means to their brand. So
            how does one stand out?
          </p>
          <p>
            This talk will help designers create visual interfaces for dense, complex products and
            make their experiences memorable and useful. The talk highlights some of the key
            differences between more traditional visual design mediums and designing for the
            interface. It will also discuss how to design a unique visual interface but put the
            needs of users first, how to add surprise and delight to critical moments of the
            experience, and how craftsmanship and attention to detail can set you apart in a
            visually complex medium.

            The tried-and-true "Don't Make Me Think" principle doesn't always hold. Discover how
            carefully placed friction in an interface can actually improve user experience by
            encouraging people to slow down and think. Complexity itself isn't bad; the trick is
            making complexity seem uncomplicated. Explore examples of websites and mobile apps that
            incorporate friction without frustration, with elegantly simple interfaces that
            nevertheless deploy complex interactions to involve users, prevent errors, improve data
            collection, and create more immersive experiences.

            In the time that I've worked with interaction designers and written about the IxD
            field, I've noticed a consistent discrepancy between the discussions that occur within
            the profession, and the impressions of those outside it. Interaction designers tend to
            have excellent communication skills when it comes to any topic other than interaction
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a real problem for the profession, which is missing opportunities to extend its
            influence and utility by communicating how valuable it is. It's an even bigger problem
            for designers outside of IxD, who continually reinvent the wheel when they fail to
            realize that many of today's design problems are, in fact, the bread and butter of
            Interaction Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            This session presents IxD as seen from the outside, starting with 10-15 quotes and/or
            video clips of non-interaction designers attempting to describe the value of IxD and
            the skillset needed to pursue it. It then summarizes these external perceptions (as
            well as my own) and contrasts them with the dialogs within IxDA and among acquaintances
            in the Portland IxD community. It concludes with suggestions for narrowing
            thisdiscrepancy through the use of metaphor, familiar terminology and example-driven
            storytelling.
