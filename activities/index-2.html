              Find and hide IxD treasure in the high-tech fun that is geocaching. Treasure hunters
              wanted! Find some treasure and hide some treasure: Learn the principles of geocaching
              and help create the Interaction11-themed cache. We'll split into groups outdoors and
              locate a few caches, then go place the conference cache. Our cache will include a
              Travel Bug which we'll address to Interaction12 in Dublin and track its progress
              online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Come with your GPS or GPS-enabled mobile device, and bring a small-sized trinket to
              leave in the cache(s). While you're at Interaction11, collect another small trinket
              or memento of your experience (but no items that will spoil). We'll create our cache
              and then hide it on campus.
            </p>
			<p>
				Geocaching [http://www.geocaching.com/default.aspx] is a worldwide game of hiding and seeking treasure. A geocacher can place a geocache in the world, pinpoint its location using GPS technology and then share the geocache's existence and location online. Anyone with a GPS device can then try to locate the geocache. A Travel Bug is a trackable tag that you attach to an item. This allows you to track your item on Geocaching.com. The item becomes a hitchhiker that is carried from cache to cache (or person to person) in the real world and you can follow its progress online.

				In case of inclement weather, an alternate activity will be provided.

              A primer for people new to the field. Interaction and UX design draw from many fields
              to create simple coherent solutions to complex problems. This eclectic mix of ideas
              and technique can sometimes be daunting to people new to the field or transitioning
              from other related disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this session, we'll explore the fundamentals of IxD. We'll look at some of the big
              ideas that the field is built on, and how these translate into practices that
              designers use every day. There'll be talk, discussion, and activities to help you
              understand the essence of this way of designing.

              Explore how design has contributed to a craft beer revolution. The recent craft beer revolution is a testament to the intentional design of culinary
              experiences. This expansion has led to an explosion in awareness and consumption of
              craft beer, and ultimately, has permanently raised the bar on what consumers should
              expect from beer.
            </p>

              During this walking tour, we'll taste different kinds of craft beers from Walnut
              Brewery, Mountain Sun Brewery and BJ's Brewhouse. But this tour isn't a pub crawl;
              it's an exploration of the beer-making process and its parallels with interaction
              design methodologies. Participants have the option to purchase their own beer; all are welcome to join in the discussion regardless of sampling.

              How can interaction design spark action about climate change? Boulder's National Center for Atmospheric Research is one of the leading research
              facilities studying weather and climate change. We'll tour the facility-- designed by
              architect I.M Pei, and perched on one of the spectacular mesas overlooking Boulder.
              We'll see how NCAR's visualization tools have changed over the decades, and talk with
              the engineers and scientists who turn their climate data into interactive models.
              They'll show us tools they're creating to give researchers, government officials and
              the general public a better understanding of what climate change means, and what to
              do about it. What can we learn from the NCAR folks who make these visualizations? How
              could we all collaborate to expand the impact of this work? Come prepared for a tour

              Rent a bike and enjoy a leisurely ride along Boulder’s many bike paths. Weather in Colorado is unpredictable, but bluebird days in February aren't as unusual
              as you might think. And when it is bluebird, biking is one of the best ways to enjoy
              the weather. The ride begins in downtown Boulder and joins up with the Boulder Creek
              Path. Riders will head east along various scenic paths and will be afforded expansive
              views of the Flatirons. The ride ends back in downtown Boulder.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of inclement weather, an alternate activity or refund will be provided. Dress for the bike and the weather - wear layers and grippy gloves. The bike rental shop may require its own waiver.

              one-hour lesson on safety and technique; then practice our skills on easy to
              difficult routes ("problems'). Open to all fitness levels from occasional exercisers

              Roll to 3 breweries on Banjo Billy's private, funky busses. Get a first-hand look at three local microbreweries as we tour the town in school
              busses disguised as traveling hillbilly shacks. First stop - Avery Brewing. We'll get
              a peek at their 240-barrel outdoor fermentation vessels and taste one of their
              full-flavored artisan beers. Next stop - Upslope Brewery, with their signature
              "Upslope Pale Ale" brewed with Patagonian hops. Final stop - Twisted Pine Brewing
              Company's 100% natural, unpasteurized pure malt ales. This experience will steep us
              in the flavor of Boulder, and allow us to enjoy each others' company (and a few
              pints) in a more casual setting.

              Basics of cocktail design, and parallels with product design. At <a href="http://www.happynoodlehouse.com/TheBitterBar/tabid/464/Default.aspx" target="_blank">The
              Bitter Bar</a>, world-renowned Mixologist Mark Stoddard will explain the basic
              principles for creating a handcrafted cocktail and its fundamental components. We
              will look at specific examples of a few classic cocktails and see how they map to
              these basic components. Then, taking cues from these principles, we'll discuss
              whether or not the same reductive logic can be applied to designing a product, and
              explore the parallels between these two creative design processes. Price includes two
              cocktails, a recipe guide, and a gift.
