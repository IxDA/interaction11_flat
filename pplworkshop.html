            Indi got her start as a software engineer building interactive models and compilers on
            supercomputers. When she switched to personal hand-held devices (the PenPoint &amp;
            Newton age), it became overwhelmingly evident to her that engineers were creating apps
            for fellow engineers. Someone needed to be able to understand the everyday person who
            was trying to make their day more effective. This is when she learned how to listen
            deeply to what people were saying--and not saying. Indi consulted for many dot-com
            start-ups, the least well-known of which actually survived. (Testmart) During the bust,
            Indi founded <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/" target="_blank">Adaptive Path</a> with six other
            user experience experts. After five years of intensive projects, Indi stepped aside to
            write her book, Mental Models. She currently consults, writes a <a href=
            "http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/mental-models" target="_blank">blog</a> at Rosenfeld Media, and

            is never achieved in isolation, but as the result of partnerships.Kendra's experience

          <p>
            Todd Zaki Warfel is the founder and principal designer at messagefirst, a design
            consultancy focused on helping companies make products and services that are beautiful,
            useful and a pleasure to use. Ask Todd what he does for a living and tell you he's just
            a designer. He believes design is a holistic practice, a craft, and like any great
            artisan, he takes great pride in his craft. He's not one to debate the intricate
            differences between information architecture, interaction design, persuasion design, or
            service design -- to him, it's all just big "D" design. Todd sees every problem as a
            design challenge, an opportunity to fix something that's broken. He's rarely satisfied
            with the status quo and believes in striving for greatness. It's this belief, combined
            with the love of craftsmanship, which lead him to become a designer.<br />
            <br />
            A designer mostly by trade and not by education, Todd holds degrees in Cognitive
            Psychology and English Creative Writing. When he graduated university, the web was
            still ruled by VAX terminals and books were printed on paper. Todd has been breaking,
            designing and crafting systems since 1995. He's been fortunate enough to design
            websites, webapps and other systems for clients such as AT&amp;T Wireless, Bankrate,
            Citi, Comcast, Cornell University, Numara and New York University. An internationally
            recognized thought leader on research and design, Todd regularly speaks at conferences
            and teaches workshops around the globe. As a member of the Web Standards Project
            Education Task Force, Todd has lead the efforts for their prototyping curricu-
            lum.<br />
            <br />
            Todd has a reputation for being a bit of a foodie and wine enthusiasts. Ask him about
            the custom walk-in wine locker at his office, which he designed and built himself. If
            you ever have the chance to go to dinner with him, chances are it will be a gastronomic
            adventure you won't soon forget. He also has a professional racing license and hopes to
            one day get his pilot's license. His new book, "Prototyping: A Practitioner's
            Guide":http://bit.ly/protobk discusses how prototypes are more than just a design tool
            and shows you how to use prototyping to create a common language, market a product,
            gain internal buy-in, and test feasibility with your development team. His newest book,
            Guer- rilla Research is due in early 2011. Todd currently lives in Philadelphia, blogs
            at zakiwarfel.com and can be found on twitter:@zakiwarfel.
